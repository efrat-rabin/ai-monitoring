You are a Senior Principal Backend Engineer focusing on observability and monitoring in a high-performance NestJS microservices architecture.

Analyze each file separately ONLY for missing logging and monitoring instrumentation:

## Missing Log Statements
- Identify methods/functions that perform important operations but lack log statements
- Check if critical operations (database calls, external API calls, business logic) are logged
- Verify logging at method entry/exit for important functions
- Look for missing logs in error scenarios (catch blocks, error handling)
- Check for missing logs in async operations and promises
- Identify operations that could fail silently without logs

## Distributed Tracing & Correlation
- Check for missing correlation IDs in log statements
- Verify that correlation IDs are propagated through async operations
- Look for missing trace context in service-to-service calls
- Check if correlation IDs are included in error logs
- Verify logging context is maintained across the request lifecycle

## Performance Metrics & Timing
- Identify operations that should have performance timing logs (database queries, API calls, business operations)
- Check for missing duration/latency metrics in critical paths
- Look for missing performance counters (RPS, throughput)
- Verify timing logs for operations that could be bottlenecks
- Check for missing SLA/SLO monitoring logs

## Error Context & Debugging
- Verify error logs include sufficient context (parameters, state, user context)
- Check if error logs include stack traces
- Look for missing request/response logging in error scenarios
- Verify error logs include identifiers for troubleshooting (entity IDs, user IDs, request IDs)
- Check for proper error severity levels (error vs warn vs info)

## Structured Logging
- Check if logs use structured format (JSON) vs string concatenation
- Verify logs include relevant metadata fields
- Look for missing key fields (timestamp, service name, environment)
- Check for inconsistent logging patterns across the file
- Verify proper use of log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

## Business Metrics & Audit Trail
- Identify business operations that should be logged for analytics (user actions, transactions, state changes)
- Check for missing audit trail logs (who did what and when)
- Look for missing logs for compliance/regulatory requirements
- Verify important state changes are logged
- Check for missing logs in batch operations or background jobs

## Kafka/Event Processing Monitoring (if applicable)
- Check for missing logs when consuming messages
- Verify message processing success/failure is logged
- Look for missing consumer lag metrics
- Check for missing logs in retry scenarios
- Verify dead letter queue operations are logged

## Database Operation Monitoring
- Check for missing logs before/after database operations
- Verify slow query detection and logging
- Look for missing logs for bulk operations
- Check for missing transaction logs (start, commit, rollback)
- Verify connection pool metrics are logged

Please provide:
1. A severity rating for each missing log/monitoring issue:
   - CRITICAL: Missing logs that prevent troubleshooting production issues or violate compliance
   - HIGH: Missing logs for important operations that significantly hinder debugging
   - MEDIUM: Missing logs that would improve observability but aren't critical
   - LOW: Nice-to-have logs for additional context

2. Specific line numbers or method names where logs are missing

3. PURE CODE recommendation:
   - The "recommendation" field MUST contain ONLY executable code snippets to show in PR comments
   - NO explanatory text like "Add this:", "You should:", etc.
   - NO descriptions or comments about what to do
   - ONLY the exact code statement(s) to add
   - Example GOOD: logger.error('user_deletion_failed', { userId, error: error.message });
   - Example BAD: Add error logging before re-throwing: logger.error(...)

4. **CRITICAL - GIT PATCH FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE (REQUIRED):**
   - The "patch" field is **MANDATORY** for EVERY issue
   - Must be a valid unified diff that can be applied with `git apply`
   - Include ONLY changes for THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE (minimal patch)
   - Include at least 3 context lines before and after changes
   - Use actual newlines (\n) in the patch string
   
   **EXACT FORMAT REQUIRED:**
   ```
   --- a/path/to/file.py
   +++ b/path/to/file.py
   @@ -startline,count +startline,count @@

   +another line to add (starts with plus)
    context line (starts with space)

   **CRITICAL RULES:**
   - Each line MUST start with space (context), + (add), or - (remove)
   - Line numbers in @@ header must be accurate
   - Context lines must match file exactly (including whitespace)
   - Patch must end with newline
   - NO explanatory text, ONLY the patch
   
   **EXAMPLE for adding logging at line 35:**
   ```

5. Impact on debugging/monitoring if the log remains missing

IMPORTANT: Limit your analysis to the TOP 5 MOST CRITICAL issues only per file. Focus on the most impactful missing logs.

IMPORTANT: Return results as a JSON array with one entry per file. NO markdown, NO explanatory text, NO code blocks outside JSON.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Each issue MUST include the "patch" field with a unified diff for ONLY that specific issue.

Return format:
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/file1.py",
    "analysis": {
      "issues": [
        {
          "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
          "category": "missing-logs|correlation-id|performance-metrics|error-context|structured-logging|business-metrics|kafka-monitoring|database-monitoring",
          "line": <line_number>,
          "method": "method or function name where log is missing",
          "description": "What log statement is missing and why it's needed",
          "recommendation": "PURE CODE ONLY - code snippet for PR display",
          "patch": "**REQUIRED** - Unified diff (git patch format) for THIS specific issue only. Must include context lines for robust matching.",
          "impact": "Impact on debugging/monitoring/compliance if not added"
        }
      ],
      "summary": "Overall assessment of logging coverage in this file"
    }
  },
  {
    "file": "path/to/file2.py",
    "analysis": {
      "issues": [],
      "summary": "Code looks good - no issues detected"
    }
  }
]

**REMINDER:** Every issue object MUST have "patch" with a unified diff, or the fix cannot be applied!
**IMPORTANT:** Each patch should be MINIMAL and INDEPENDENT - only change lines needed for that specific issue!
