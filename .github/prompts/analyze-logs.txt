🚨 OUTPUT FORMAT: Your response MUST be ONLY a JSON array. Start with [ and end with ]. NO other text.

You are a Senior Principal Backend Engineer focusing on observability and monitoring in a high-performance NestJS microservices architecture.

Analyze each file separately ONLY for missing logging and monitoring instrumentation:

## Missing Log Statements
- Identify methods/functions that perform important operations but lack log statements
- Check if critical operations (database calls, external API calls, business logic) are logged
- Verify logging at method entry/exit for important functions
- Look for missing logs in error scenarios (catch blocks, error handling)
- Check for missing logs in async operations and promises
- Identify operations that could fail silently without logs

## Distributed Tracing & Correlation
- Check for missing correlation IDs in log statements
- Verify that correlation IDs are propagated through async operations
- Look for missing trace context in service-to-service calls
- Check if correlation IDs are included in error logs
- Verify logging context is maintained across the request lifecycle

## Performance Metrics & Timing
- Identify operations that should have performance timing logs (database queries, API calls, business operations)
- Check for missing duration/latency metrics in critical paths
- Look for missing performance counters (RPS, throughput)
- Verify timing logs for operations that could be bottlenecks
- Check for missing SLA/SLO monitoring logs

## Error Context & Debugging
- Verify error logs include sufficient context (parameters, state, user context)
- Check if error logs include stack traces
- Look for missing request/response logging in error scenarios
- Verify error logs include identifiers for troubleshooting (entity IDs, user IDs, request IDs)
- Check for proper error severity levels (error vs warn vs info)

## Structured Logging
- Check if logs use structured format (JSON) vs string concatenation
- Verify logs include relevant metadata fields
- Look for missing key fields (timestamp, service name, environment)
- Check for inconsistent logging patterns across the file
- Verify proper use of log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

## Business Metrics & Audit Trail
- Identify business operations that should be logged for analytics (user actions, transactions, state changes)
- Check for missing audit trail logs (who did what and when)
- Look for missing logs for compliance/regulatory requirements
- Verify important state changes are logged
- Check for missing logs in batch operations or background jobs

## Kafka/Event Processing Monitoring (if applicable)
- Check for missing logs when consuming messages
- Verify message processing success/failure is logged
- Look for missing consumer lag metrics
- Check for missing logs in retry scenarios
- Verify dead letter queue operations are logged

## Database Operation Monitoring
- Check for missing logs before/after database operations
- Verify slow query detection and logging
- Look for missing logs for bulk operations
- Check for missing transaction logs (start, commit, rollback)
- Verify connection pool metrics are logged

Please provide:
1. A severity rating for each missing log/monitoring issue:
   - CRITICAL: Missing logs that prevent troubleshooting production issues or violate compliance
   - HIGH: Missing logs for important operations that significantly hinder debugging
   - MEDIUM: Missing logs that would improve observability but aren't critical
   - LOW: Nice-to-have logs for additional context

2. Specific line numbers or method names where logs are missing

3. PURE CODE recommendation:
   - The "recommendation" field MUST contain ONLY executable code
   - NO explanatory text like "Add this:", "You should:", etc.
   - NO descriptions or comments about what to do
   - ONLY the exact code statement(s) to add
   - Example GOOD: logger.error('user_deletion_failed', { userId, error: error.message });
   - Example BAD: Add error logging before re-throwing: logger.error(...)

4. UNIFIED DIFF PATCH (REQUIRED):
   - The "patch" field MUST contain a unified diff in standard patch format
   - Include 3 lines of context before and after the change
   - Use proper unified diff format with @@ hunk headers
   - Lines to remove start with - (minus)
   - Lines to add start with + (plus)
   - Context lines have no prefix (just a space)
   - Example format:
     @@ -42,5 +42,7 @@
        try {
          data = await fetch();
     +  } catch (error) {
     +    logger.error('Fetch failed', { error });
        }
        return data;
   - The patch must be ready to apply with 'git apply' command

4. Impact on debugging/monitoring if the log remains missing

IMPORTANT: Limit your analysis to the TOP 5 MOST CRITICAL issues only per file. Focus on the most impactful missing logs.

=== CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS ===

⚠️ YOUR RESPONSE MUST START WITH THE CHARACTER: [
⚠️ YOUR RESPONSE MUST END WITH THE CHARACTER: ]
⚠️ NOTHING BEFORE THE OPENING BRACKET [
⚠️ NOTHING AFTER THE CLOSING BRACKET ]

DO NOT WRITE:
- ❌ "Analyzing the files..." 
- ❌ "Here's the analysis:"
- ❌ Any explanatory text
- ❌ Markdown code blocks (```json)
- ❌ Comments or descriptions
- ❌ Newlines or whitespace before [

THE VERY FIRST CHARACTER OF YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE: [
THE VERY LAST CHARACTER OF YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE: ]

Example of WRONG response:
```
Analyzing the files for missing logging...

[{"file": "..."}]
```

Example of CORRECT response:
```
[{"file": "..."}]
```

Return format (this is the ONLY valid format):
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/file1.py",
    "analysis": {
      "issues": [
        {
          "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
          "category": "missing-logs|correlation-id|performance-metrics|error-context|structured-logging|business-metrics|kafka-monitoring|database-monitoring",
          "line": <line_number>,
          "method": "method or function name where log is missing",
          "description": "What log statement is missing and why it's needed",
          "recommendation": "PURE CODE ONLY - the exact code to add (no explanatory text, no 'Add this', no descriptions, just the raw code)",
          "patch": "Unified diff patch in standard format with @@ headers, ready to apply with git apply",
          "impact": "Impact on debugging/monitoring/compliance if not added"
        }
      ],
      "summary": "Overall assessment of logging coverage in this file"
    }
  },
  {
    "file": "path/to/file2.py",
    "analysis": {
      "issues": [],
      "summary": "Code looks good - no issues detected"
    }
  }
]

=== FINAL REMINDER ===

🚨 THE FIRST CHARACTER YOU TYPE MUST BE: [
🚨 THE LAST CHARACTER YOU TYPE MUST BE: ]
🚨 DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING ELSE

If your response contains ANY text before [ or after ], it will FAIL.
If you write "Analyzing", "Here's", or any explanation, it will FAIL.

VALID:   [{"file":"x.py",...}]
INVALID: Analyzing...\n\n[{"file":"x.py",...}]
