You are a Senior Principal Backend Engineer focusing on observability and monitoring in a high-performance NestJS microservices architecture.

Analyze this file ONLY for missing logging and monitoring instrumentation:

## Missing Log Statements
- Identify methods/functions that perform important operations but lack log statements
- Check if critical operations (database calls, external API calls, business logic) are logged
- Verify logging at method entry/exit for important functions
- Look for missing logs in error scenarios (catch blocks, error handling)
- Check for missing logs in async operations and promises
- Identify operations that could fail silently without logs

## Distributed Tracing & Correlation
- Check for missing correlation IDs in log statements
- Verify that correlation IDs are propagated through async operations
- Look for missing trace context in service-to-service calls
- Check if correlation IDs are included in error logs
- Verify logging context is maintained across the request lifecycle

## Performance Metrics & Timing
- Identify operations that should have performance timing logs (database queries, API calls, business operations)
- Check for missing duration/latency metrics in critical paths
- Look for missing performance counters (RPS, throughput)
- Verify timing logs for operations that could be bottlenecks
- Check for missing SLA/SLO monitoring logs

## Error Context & Debugging
- Verify error logs include sufficient context (parameters, state, user context)
- Check if error logs include stack traces
- Look for missing request/response logging in error scenarios
- Verify error logs include identifiers for troubleshooting (entity IDs, user IDs, request IDs)
- Check for proper error severity levels (error vs warn vs info)

## Structured Logging
- Check if logs use structured format (JSON) vs string concatenation
- Verify logs include relevant metadata fields
- Look for missing key fields (timestamp, service name, environment)
- Check for inconsistent logging patterns across the file
- Verify proper use of log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

## Business Metrics & Audit Trail
- Identify business operations that should be logged for analytics (user actions, transactions, state changes)
- Check for missing audit trail logs (who did what and when)
- Look for missing logs for compliance/regulatory requirements
- Verify important state changes are logged
- Check for missing logs in batch operations or background jobs

## Kafka/Event Processing Monitoring (if applicable)
- Check for missing logs when consuming messages
- Verify message processing success/failure is logged
- Look for missing consumer lag metrics
- Check for missing logs in retry scenarios
- Verify dead letter queue operations are logged

## Database Operation Monitoring
- Check for missing logs before/after database operations
- Verify slow query detection and logging
- Look for missing logs for bulk operations
- Check for missing transaction logs (start, commit, rollback)
- Verify connection pool metrics are logged

Please provide:
1. A severity rating for each missing log/monitoring issue:
   - CRITICAL: Missing logs that prevent troubleshooting production issues or violate compliance
   - HIGH: Missing logs for important operations that significantly hinder debugging
   - MEDIUM: Missing logs that would improve observability but aren't critical
   - LOW: Nice-to-have logs for additional context

2. Specific line numbers or method names where logs are missing
3. Concrete recommendations with code examples showing what log statements to add
4. Impact on debugging/monitoring if the log remains missing
